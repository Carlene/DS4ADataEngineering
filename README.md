# Job Scraper
(WIP) Will go through Data job listings, and return a csv of job titles, descriptions, qualifications, and responsibilities for each job posting.

At the moment, run.py is the file that will run the scraper and dump the data into a CSV file.

Sites the scraper works for:
Crocs
Dick's Sporting Goods
